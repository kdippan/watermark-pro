## 📖 About The Project

**Watermark Pro** is a modern, privacy-focused web application that allows photographers and content creators to watermark their images securely. 

Unlike other tools that upload your photos to a remote server, **Watermark Pro processes everything locally in your browser**. This means your high-resolution original photos never leave your device, ensuring 100% privacy and lightning-fast speeds.

### ✨ Key Features

* **🔒 100% Private:** Powered by HTML5 Canvas. No server uploads.
* **🚀 Batch Processing:** Watermark hundreds of photos in seconds.
* **🎨 Advanced Editor:** * Add **Text** and **Logo** layers.
    * Drag, drop, rotate, and scale watermarks.
    * Adjust opacity and colors.
    * **Tiling Mode:** Repeat your watermark across the entire image automatically.
* **💾 Smart History:** Local activity log tracks your exports and settings.
* **⚡ Productivity Tools:** * **Presets:** Save your favorite watermark styles.
    * **Undo/Redo:** Full history stack for mistakes.
    * **Zoom/Pan:** Precise control over placement.
* **🌙 Dark/Light Mode:** Beautiful UI that adapts to your preference.
* **📦 Bulk Export:** Downloads processed images as a ZIP file.
